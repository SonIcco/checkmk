Title: Validate configured rules when updating configuration

The Checkmk update procedure (<tt>cmk-update-config</tt>) now validates all configured rules
and logs "ERROR: Invalid rule configuration detected" in case of an error. If you encounter
such errors, your configuration contains rules that need to be corrected. We recommend to open
the affected rules in the GUI. Upon attempting to save them, any problematic field will be
highlighted.

Invalid rule values can for example originate from invalid regular expressions, which were
unfortunately still allowed in Python 2 but are forbidden in Python 3, see also
